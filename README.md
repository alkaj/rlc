# rlc
Real Life Chat
# what is it?
rlc is a chat app create to demonstrate how to transform a web page into a firefox os application for the 
'from web developer to firefox os app developer' workshop organised by Firefox OS Cameroon (follow @B2GCmr on twitter).
# What has it special?
with rlc, you can not chat with more than one person if you are not speaking together.
if you want to speak with somebody else to something else, you have to explicitly leave the first conversation
yeah it's all real!!!!.
